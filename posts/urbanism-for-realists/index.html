    <blockquote>
<p>&quot;Amsterdam wasn't built in a day.&quot; - David Hamilton</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who has spent the last three years online, knows about the amazing rise in Urbanism content online. From the top dogs NotJustBikes and Adam Something to more obscure content creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OhTheUrbanity">Oh The Urbanity!</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PaigeMTL">Paige Saunders</a>. This is all good, I'm glad to see more advocacy for people-centric Urbanism online. However, I feel like a dark undertone had taken over some Urbanist spaces, that being the &quot;Urban Idealists&quot;.</p>
<p>The Urban Idealist believes that their silver bullet ideas would transform cities into Utopia, regardless of the pre-existing socioeconomic conditions. To them, we can easily disregard a city‚Äôs culture, transport methods, climate, geography. All cities can be exactly like Amsterdam or Barcelona. While it is true that some of the NIMBY ‚Äúcomplaints‚Äù raise these points, dismissing them outright is not a good response.</p>
<h2>Be Pragmatic</h2>
<p>What works in city ùë• may not work in ùë¶. Ignoring the existing city design, both in its infrastructure and culture, may result in ineffective reforms and redesigns happening. Take my home city of Jakarta. Like American cities, we have Cars and Stroads which were built from bulldozing old buildings and Tram Infrastructure, but unlike most American cities. We have the Angkot or Microbus that lower income Jakartans take. In fact, it‚Äôs so successful that a version of Angkots (Called Mikrotrans) are officially part of Jakarta‚Äôs official system nowadays! <a href="https://www.kompas.com/tren/read/2022/02/02/103000765/mengenal-mikrotrans-angkot-ber-ac-di-jakarta-dengan-segudang-fasilitas?page=all">1</a></p>
<p><img src="https://dispatch.jakarta.dj/images/posts/urbanism-for-realists/angkot.jpeg" alt="Image of a Jak Lingko Angkot"></p>
<p>But now time to turn into what we do worse than US Cities, Jakarta has Mopeds, a lot of Mopeds. And the riders of those mopeds are the craziest people on the road! They not only flagrantly ignore stop lights when the opportunity arises, but they‚Äôll ride on the separated Bike Lane or even the god-damn Pavement! <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-indonesia-pavements/jakartans-walk-the-walk-to-regain-their-pavement-idUSLNE83102120120402">2</a></p>
<p><img src="https://dispatch.jakarta.dj/images/posts/urbanism-for-realists/mopeds-on-pavement.jpg" alt="Image of Mopeds on a Pavement disturbing pedestrians"></p>
<p>Clearly, this means that regular Dutch urban policies will not necessarily work, and if we were to import them, we will have to figure out how to adapt them to local conditions. Urbanists shouldn't advocate mass replanning of everything immediately, but rather go through it step by step to minimize backlash. And tune city planning policies to how people react to those changes in urban design. Similar to the RCTs being used in Development Economics <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-randomised-trials-became-big-in-development-economics-128398">3</a>.</p>
<p>Which brings me to‚Ä¶</p>
<h2>Yes, Culture Matters</h2>
<p>Amsterdam and other Dutch cities are successful not only due to their excellent infrastructure, but also their culture. It is fair to avoid discussions of culture in transport policymaking to avoid distractions from more core issues, but, as Alex Davis writes in his video essay about his visit to the Netherlands <a href="https://youtu.be/UB8HI_luyRU?t=281">4</a>. Even though Giethoorn (A village famous for being car-free and usage of boats)‚Äôs bus service is by most measures, awful, people still use it often due to the Dutch cultural expectation that transit is the way to travel long distances.</p>
<p>Davis then goes to examples of subpar unprotected bike infrastructure, yet argues that they are still safer than protected bike lanes in the US because of the cultural expectation that you respect bicycle infrastructure.</p>
<p>Despite the gloomy attitude this section gives, there are ways to influence change in culture through policymaking. Davis gives the examples of giving schoolchildren free transit passes, or increasing bicycle use by incentivising small deliveries to be done by cargo bikes.</p>
<p>One interesting example is Rio de Janeiro. People used to not care about drink-driving, until there was a mass campaign in the mid-2000s to eradicate the practice, it was a mix of advertisements and heavy enforcement by the police. Now, most people in Rio wouldn't consider drinking and driving, even if they're in a part of Brazil where consequences for drink-driving aren‚Äôt enforced. (Thanks to D√©carte for pointing this out).</p>
<h2>Hit close to home</h2>
<p>Amsterdam, as it is now, was not built in a day. It was being redesigned for the car when they got cheap in the 60s, until the 70s, when traffic deaths were as high as 9 people dying each day. People started protesting to demand better cycling policies, the most notable of this was the <em>Stop de Kindermoord</em> (EN: Stop the Children Slaughter) Movement, policymakers were moved, and notable experiments to improve cycling safety were done. Those experiments eventually became the standard-bearer for cycle lanes in the Netherlands <a href="https://youtu.be/SYHz93HXJFQ">5</a>.</p>
<p>I feel like from the example of Amsterdam, Urbanist campaigners should focus on sending messages that resonate with the local community rather than more detached concepts. ‚ÄúSolving Climate Change‚Äù is nice, but ‚ÄúMake Kids Safe in our Area‚Äù is better.</p>
<h2>Big-Tent Coalition</h2>
<p>The sister movement of the Urbanists is the YIMBY movement, and I‚Äôd say Urbanists have a lot to learn from them. One notable thing is they are Big-Tent movements with a defined focus. They transcend ideology, you‚Äôll find socialists, liberals, libertarians, conservatives, etc in one room <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210521051949/https://exponentsmag.org/2021/05/20/against-activist-mission-creep">6</a>. The urbanist movement, on the other hand, seems more slanted and less of a big-tent which risks of it being the centre of the culture war (Yes I am aware that it partially already is <a href="https://youtu.be/7z8Tb7OA_F4">7</a>, but it‚Äôs not in the spotlight unlike, sadly, Transgender Rights).</p>
<p>In his book <em>Of Boys and Men</em>, Richard V. Reeves writes how cultural warfare and wedge issues lead to pointless bickering and failure to address real issues <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/book/of-boys-and-men">8</a>. I fear that may happen to Urbanism.</p>
<h2>In Closing</h2>
