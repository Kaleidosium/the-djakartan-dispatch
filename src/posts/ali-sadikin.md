The following is a brief article about Ali Sadikin, I originally wanted to write more, but I realized that it would be inappropriate for a general overview of him to include.

Ali Sadikin is one person not commonly known or talked about outside of Indonesia. He was the Fourth Governor of Jakarta during the Suharto Dictatorship, and he's widely known here as probably the most influential governor in the History of Jakarta. Ali had positions in power before becoming Governor, but I want to focus on his governorship, as that's what most people know him for.

If you want to know one thing about Ali, He was ruthlessly pragmatic. Legalizing gambling and prostitution to fund education and other public services. He was liberal enough to sign the Petition of Fifty, an anti-government document, and was nominated as an alternative president by Students during a protest. Yet authoritarian enough to forcibly clear out slums, ban *becaks* (cycle rickshaws), and outlaw street peddlers.

He supported unpopular policies like family planning, which was eventually accepted in the mainstream, and support for Waria (A form of Third Gender), which wasn't very accepted at all. Ali famously attended the wedding of Indonesia's first trans woman legally recognized as her true gender, Vivian Rubiyanti Iskandar.

Most people remember him today for Infrastructure and Transportation. Ali oversaw the construction and inauguration of Ismail Marzuki Park, Ancol Dreamland, and even the revitalization of Senen. He laid the groundwork for the modern Jakartan Public Transit system, and motor vehicle usage exploded during his tenure.

Ali Sadikin was eventually removed from power on July 5, 1977, after having allegedly "allowed" Golkar to lose an election in Jakarta and later became the chairman of the Indonesian Football Association. On May 20, 2008, he passed away in Singapore and was buried in Tanah Kusir Cemetery in Jakarta the following day, as was his wish.

## My Opinion of Ali Sadikin

Ali Sadikin was someone who I as an Indonesian Liberal have had a complex relationship with. He, like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, transformed Jakarta from an impoverished post-colonial mess to the start of the mega metropolis that you see today with an iron fist. At the same time, his authoritarianism was more pragmatic than the more totalitarian bent you see with Suharto.

I'd even go as far as to argue that Ali, not Suharto is the LKY of Indonesia. Ali and LKY both are fiscally pragmatic, authoritarian-leaning leaders who led their citizens to prosperity. Suharto was a corrupt militarist who embezzled a lot of money from international organizations, and I'd argue he wasn't that good of a leader, to begin with.

I hope this article sparks more interest in reading about Bang Ali. I recommend Tirto's Articles on him (Google Translate should be accurate enough for Indonesian), and the English Wikipedia page to start. Thank you for reading.
