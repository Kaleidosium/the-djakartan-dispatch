The Djakartan Dispatch is a website created by [Dania Rifki](https://kaleidosium.github.io/?videodrugsdisable=true) covering topics in the spirit of [slow journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_journalism), this website is updated infrequently without a schedule.

The website's name uses the old Van Ophuijsen or Republican spelling of `Djakarta` instead of `Jakarta` for aesthetic reasons.

The minimalist no nonsense design of this website was a reaction to the bloated maximalist mess that is most mainstream Indonesian news sites. We wanted to differentiate this website from them by having a more calmer and minimal approach to design, which hopefully reflects the content.

Feel free to contact the dispatch on thedjakartandispatch `at` protonmail `dot` com. We love getting feedback, we also accept guest post submissions!

Lastly, the website was built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and its theme was forked from [eleventy-duo](https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo) by [Yinka Adedire](https://github.com/yinkakun).
